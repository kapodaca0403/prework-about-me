      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a single mother of two dogs, haha just kidding. Well, I do have two dogs. One super moody husky and a sweet jack russ. I decided to enroll in bootcampo because I had the opportunity to take the course and given the chance to learn something new.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Colorado! Although, I have explored a lot of Colorado there are still a lot of places on my bucket list.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Hmm, playing video games and binge watching different shows when I get the chance. Nothing beats having a handful of snacks and a good show to watch. I mean, I like going hiking and exploring Colorado too. Colorado has some extremely beautiful places with stunning views and I like trying different restaurants. I am a foodie.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Truthfully. to be a radio host. My favorite stations are KUVO Jazz and KOVD Classical. One because I love both genres of music and I would love to be able to play pieces by my favorite composers. Also, being able to see new changes and new composers. You find out a lot about musicians when listening to KUVO Jazz. I love it and I hope I can be a host one day.<3</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I now live in Sunnyside Centennial.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Honestly, because of the pandemic finding a job has been a dud. I was aimlessly scrolling on LinkedIn and I found the DU bootcamp link. My previous work experience would make my resume look jazzy with a certificate. I've taken a web design call in highschool so, I thought...might as well take a leap of faith. Boom, here I am. I am super excited to see what new endeavors I can tackle and explore.</p>
